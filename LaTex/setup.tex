\section{Basic Setup}
In the following we assume having a liquid market with options trading at strikes $K_{min}<K<K_{max}$ and time-to-maturities $T_{min}<T<T_{max}$. We denote the observed price of a call option by $C(T,K)$ and define $S$ and $r$ to be the observed market price and the observed interest rate.
